Feature: An example issue tracking flow that is set up with django-river

  . POTENTIAL PROBLEM AREAS:
  .   * The workflow creation with all the components like states, transitions, authorization rules may have unexpected problems
  .   * Authorized person may not be able to approve the transition
  .   * What is going on with one issue may be affecting another issue.
  .   * Recursive transitions may be working as expected
