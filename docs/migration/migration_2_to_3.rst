2.X.X to 3.0.0
==============

``django-river`` v3.0.0 comes with quite number of migrations, but the good news is that even though those are hard to determine kind of migrations, it comes with the required migrations
out of the box. All you need to do is to run;


   .. code:: bash

       python manage.py migrate river
