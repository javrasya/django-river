Functions
=========

Functions are the description in ``Python`` of what you want to do on certain events happen. So you define them once and you can use them
with multiple hooking up. Just go to ``/admin/river/function/`` admin page and create your functions there.``django-river`` function admin support
python code highlighting as well if you enable the ``codemirror2`` app. Don't forget to collect statics for production deployments.


   .. code:: python

       INSTALLED_APPS=[
           ...
           codemirror2
           river
           ...
       ]

Here is an example function;

   .. code:: python

        from datetime import datetime

        def handle(context):
            print(datetime.now())

**Important:** **YOUR FUNCTION SHOULD BE NAMED AS** ``handle``. Otherwise ``django-river`` won't execute your function.

Context Parameter
-----------------

``django-river`` will pass a ``context`` down to your function in order for you to know why the function is triggered or for which object or so. And the ``context``
will look different for different type of events. But it also has some common parts for all the events. Let's look at how it looks;


``context.hook ->>``

+---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
|      Key            |  Type  |       Format       |                       Description                       |
+=====================+========+====================+=========================================================+
| type                | String | | * on-approved    | | The event type that is hooked up. The payload will    |
|                     |        | | * on-transit     | | likely differ according to this value                 |
|                     |        | | * on-complete    |                                                         |
+---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| when                | String | | * BEFORE         | | Whether it is hooked right before the event happens   |
|                     |        | | * AFTER          | | or right after                                        |
+---------------------+--------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| payload             | dict   |                    | | This is the context content that will differ for each |
|                     |        |                    | | event type. The information that can be gotten from   |
|                     |        |                    | | payload is describe in the table below                |
